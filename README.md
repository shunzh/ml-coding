## Machine Learning Interview Prep

This repository provides a collection of machine learning problems commonly encountered in technical interviews. It's
designed for individuals with a solid knowledge base who want to practice implementing these algorithms.

**What's Included:**

* **problems**: This directory holds implementations for various machine learning algorithms:
    * **deep_learning**: Problems related to deep learning, including:
        * `mlp.py`: Multi-Layer Perceptron implementation.
        * `tensor_ops.py`: Custom tensor operations for deep learning.
    * **k_means.py**: Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
    * **knn.py**: Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
    * **linear_regression.py**: Implementation of linear regression with gradient descent.
    * **logistic_regression.py**: Implementation of logistic regression.
    * **rl**: Problems related to reinforcement learning, including:
        * `compute_value_of_policy.py`: Functions for calculating policy values.
        * `ppo.py`: Implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.
* **tests**: This directory contains unit tests for the implemented algorithms:
    * Tests mirror the structure of the `problems` directory and ensure the functionality of each implementation.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Choose a problem from the `problems` directory and practice implementing your own solution.
4. Refer to the provided implementations for guidance, but aim to solve the problems independently.

**Note:**

This repository focuses purely on practical implementation and does not include detailed explanations of the algorithms.
